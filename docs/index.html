    <h1>Cross-Domain Fault Detection through Optimal Transport</h1>
    <br>
    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p class="text-block">
        Automatic fault diagnosis systems are an important component for fault tolerance in modern control loops. Nonetheless, the training of such diagnosis systems
        can be costly or even dangerous since faulty data need to be collected by driving the process to dangerous conditions. A possible solution to the said problem
        is training an automatic diagnosis system solely on simulation data. However, due to modeling errors, the data acquired may not reflect real process data.
        This is characterized by a change in the probability distributions upon which data is sampled. This problem is known in the literature as domain adaptation or
        cross-domain fault diagnosis in our context. Thus this work analyzes the cross-domain diagnosis problem through the point of view of optimal transport. We apply
        our methodology in a case study concerning the continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) system. Our contributions are three-fold: 1. we perform a comparative study
        concerning feature extraction and domain adaptation algorithms, 2. we analyze the relation between wrongful model specification and the distance between source
        and target distributions, and its impact on classification performance 3. we analyze the impact of modeling errors in the quality of optimal transport plans,
        and the influence of this latter factor into classification performance.
        <br>
        In summary, we found that optimal transport-based domain adaptation is the best choice for solving the distributional shift problem. In addition, we further
        verified that an increasing degree of modeling error is correlated with an increase in the distance between source and target distributions. Furthermore,
        we found experimentally that the latter distance is correlated with a decrease in classification performance, confirming previous theoretical findings.
        Finally, the degree of modeling error can cause the transportation plan between source and target domain to transfer mass between different classes, harming
        classification performance.
